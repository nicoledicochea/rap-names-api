## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS

A simple API with a database of information on a given rapper's:

- Age
- Birth Name
- Birth Location

## Optimizations

I would love to add the following:
- More rappers
- More information per rapper (ie. their top songs, any awards, etc)
- Expand the API documentation

## Lessons Learned:

My first experience with building my own API! I learned a lot about using Express and serving requests to client side code. This opens up the doors for creating more elaborate APIs on other topics!


## Examples:
Take a look at these apps I've created using public APIs:

- [San Jose Solar Seekers Picture of the Day](https://github.com/nicoledicochea/nasa-picture-of-the-day)

- [The Best Advice No One Told You](https://github.com/nicoledicochea/advice-bot)

- [Picturesque](https://github.com/nicoledicochea/picturesque-pixabay-api)
